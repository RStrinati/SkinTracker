# Railway Environment Variables Checklist

## âœ… Required Environment Variables

Before deploying to Railway, ensure ALL these variables are set in your Railway dashboard:

### 1. **Telegram Bot** (REQUIRED)
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = <your_telegram_bot_token>
```
Get from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.

### 2. **Supabase Database** (REQUIRED)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
Get from Supabase Dashboard â†’ Project Settings â†’ API

**Alternative (if service role key not available):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### 3. **OpenAI API** (REQUIRED for skin analysis)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-...
```
Get from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 4. **Railway Public URL** (Auto-set after first deploy)
```
BASE_URL = https://your-service.railway.app
```
This is automatically available as `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`, but you may need to set it manually for webhook registration.

2. Click on your service
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Click **"+ New Variable"**
5. Add each variable one by one
6. Click **"Deploy"** to apply changes

### Via Railway CLI:

## âœ… Verification Commands

After setting variables, verify they're loaded correctly:

### Check Railway Variables:
```bash
railway variables
```

### Check Application Logs:
Look for these startup messages in Railway logs:
```
âœ… Environment - Railway: True
âœ… Bot initialization started
âœ… Database connected successfully
âœ… Initialized storage bucket: skin-photos
âœ… Scheduler started with 2 jobs
```

### Test Health Endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"healthy"}
```

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues

### Issue: "Bot token not found"
**Fix:** Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in Railway variables

### Issue: "Supabase connection failed"
**Fix:** Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are correct

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"
**Fix:** Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid and has credits

### Issue: Webhook registration fails
**Fix:** Set `BASE_URL` to your Railway public domain (e.g., `https://skintracker-production.up.railway.app`)

## ðŸ“ž Support

If deployment still fails after setting all variables:

3. Ensure Supabase storage bucket "skin-photos" exists
4. Confirm OpenAI API key has available credits
