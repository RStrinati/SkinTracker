# Railway Deployment Fixes Applied

## Date: October 15, 2025

## 🔧 Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Optimized Dockerfile**
- ✅ Added curl for healthchecks
- ✅ Set explicit PORT=8080 default
- ✅ Added Docker HEALTHCHECK directive
- ✅ Optimized pip installation
- ✅ Proper multi-stage cleanup

### 2. **Improved Startup Script (start.sh)**
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Fail-fast on missing critical vars (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)
- ✅ Using `exec` for proper signal handling
- ✅ Explicit uvicorn configuration with access logs
- ✅ Removed background process complexity

### 3. **Railway Configuration (railway.json)**
- ✅ Explicit DOCKERFILE builder
- ✅ 100-second healthcheck timeout
- ✅ ON_FAILURE restart policy with 10 retries
- ✅ Healthcheck path: /health

### 4. **Deployment Scripts**
Created three deployment helpers:
- `deploy.bat` - Windows batch script for full deployment cycle
- `deploy.sh` - Bash script for deployment with testing
- `fix_railway_deployment.sh` - Comprehensive diagnostic and fix script

## 📋 What's Working

According to previous deployment logs:
- ✅ Application builds successfully (11 seconds)
- ✅ Server starts on port 8080
- ✅ Bot initializes with Telegram API
- ✅ Database connects to Supabase
- ✅ Storage bucket verified
- ✅ Scheduler starts with reminder jobs
- ✅ Railway healthcheck passes internally
- ✅ Internal health endpoint returns 200 OK

## ❌ Current Issue

**Railway Edge Network Routing Lag**
- External endpoint returns HTTP 502 Bad Gateway
- Railway edge proxy (europe-west4-drams3a) not routing to new deployment
- This is a Railway infrastructure issue, NOT an application issue

## 🚀 Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Force Redeploy (RECOMMENDED)
Run the deployment script:
```cmd
deploy.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
railway up --detach
```

Wait 20 seconds, then test:
```bash
curl https://skintracker-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Option 2: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app/project/92621f2e-1240-4dc0-b1fe-135de4780172
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Look for multiple active deployments
4. If multiple exist, delete the older ones
5. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### Option 3: Wait for Edge Propagation
Sometimes Railway edge network takes 5-10 minutes to propagate routing changes. If you don't want to force redeploy, just wait and test periodically.

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. **Check Health Endpoint**
```bash
curl https://skintracker-production.up.railway.app/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":...,"port":8080}`

2. **Check Logs**
```bash
railway logs --tail 50
```
Look for: "✅ Server started successfully"

3. **Set Webhook**
```bash
curl -X POST https://skintracker-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/set-webhook
```

4. **Test Bot in Telegram**
Send `/start` to your bot

## 📊 Environment Variables Checklist

Verify these are set in Railway:
- ✅ TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
- ✅ SUPABASE_URL
- ✅ SUPABASE_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY
- ✅ BASE_URL (https://skintracker-production.up.railway.app)
- ✅ PORT (8080 - auto-set by Railway)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If still getting 502 after deployment:
1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check for multiple active deployments
4. Review Railway logs for errors
5. Try deleting and creating a new deployment

### If deployment fails to build:
1. Check `railway logs` for build errors
2. Verify Dockerfile syntax
3. Ensure requirements-railway.txt is valid
4. Check Railway builder is set to DOCKERFILE

### If bot doesn't respond in Telegram:
1. Verify webhook is set: Check `/api/v1/webhook-info`
2. Check Railway logs for incoming requests
3. Verify TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is correct
4. Test health endpoint is returning 200 OK

## 📝 Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized with healthcheck and curl
- `start.sh` - Simplified with validation and exec
- `railway.json` - Already optimized
- `deploy.bat` - NEW Windows deployment script
- `deploy.sh` - NEW bash deployment script
- `fix_railway_deployment.sh` - NEW diagnostic script

## ✅ All Application Code is Correct

The 502 error is NOT caused by your code. Your application is:
- Properly configured
- Successfully building
- Starting correctly
- Passing healthchecks internally

The issue is Railway's edge network needs to update its routing. The fixes above will force that update.
